# Teachable Machine and Keras-Hub Examples

This repository contains various demonstrations of Google's **Teachable Machine** framework and **Keras Hub** implementations for image, audio, video, and text classification. These demos are split into categories, ranging from beginner to expert levels, and come with YouTube video explanations for each.

## Google Teachable Machine Examples

Google Teachable Machine is a simple way to train machine learning models without needing to write any code. Below are the updated demos using **text**, **image**, **video**, and **audio** inputs.

### Image Classification

We built a custom image classification model for **agriculture crop classification**, trained using Teachable Machine. This helps identify crop types using image inputs.

### Video/Pose Classification

This demo classifies short video clips to detect **"Phone" vs. "No Phone"** scenarios â€” useful for distracted driving detection and similar use cases.

### Audio Classification

This project uses audio input to distinguish between **guitar sounds** and **background noise**. It can be used for sound-based filtering in smart environments.

## Keras Hub Examples

Keras Hub allows users to leverage pre-trained models with minimal code for tasks like image and text classification. Below are two comprehensive Colab notebooks covering all levels (beginner to expert) for each domain.

### Image Classification (Beginner to Expert)

This notebook covers:
- Beginner: Using a pre-trained Keras model to classify images with minimal setup  
- Intermediate: Applying transfer learning on a small custom dataset  
- Advanced: Fine-tuning deeper layers with augmentation and callbacks  
- Expert: Custom training loops and hyperparameter tuning with Keras Hub
