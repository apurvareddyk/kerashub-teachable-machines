## Google Teachable Machine Examples

Google Teachable Machine is a simple way to train machine learning models without needing to write any code. Below are three examples using **text**, **image**, and **video** inputs.

### Text Classification
In this demo, I trained a Teachable Machine model to classify different types of text based on simple inputs (e.g., greeting vs. farewell messages).

### Image Classification
This demo showcases a custom image classification model trained using Teachable Machine. It classifies images based on categories such as "cats," "dogs," and "bicycles."

## Keras Hub Examples

Keras Hub allows users to leverage pre-trained models with minimal code to solve various problems in text and image classification. Below are examples ranging from easy to expert levels for both images and text.

### Easy Image Classification
In this example, I used a pre-trained model for basic image classification with the Keras Hub API. The goal is to show how to use pre-trained models to classify images with minimal setup.
