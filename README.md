## Google Teachable Machine Examples

Google Teachable Machine is a simple way to train machine learning models without needing to write any code. Below are the updated demos using **text**, **image**, **video**, and **audio** inputs.

### Text Classification

In this demo, we trained a Teachable Machine model to classify different types of text, such as greetings and farewells.

### Image Classification

We built a custom image classification model for **agriculture crop classification**, trained using Teachable Machine. This helps identify crop types using image inputs.

### Video Classification

This demo classifies short video clips to detect **"Phone" vs. "No Phone"** scenarios â€” useful for distracted driving detection and similar use cases.

### Audio Classification

This project uses audio input to distinguish between **guitar sounds** and **background noise**. It can be used for sound-based filtering in smart environments.

## Keras Hub Examples

Keras Hub allows users to leverage pre-trained models with minimal code for tasks like text and image classification. Below are placeholder examples which will be updated soon.

### Image Classification (Keras Hub)

This example will demonstrate how to use a pre-trained Keras model for basic image classification.
